# \#B4mad Racing

## Your trusted Track Record to accelerate your racing career

## Why

Sim racers enjoy collecting data, improving their skills, and a healthy competition. Grinding laps on a single track and shaving those milliseconds off of a lap time requires dedication and a long-term investment: hundreds if not thousands of detailed, analysed training laps.

*\#B4mad Racing* provides a driver’s history \- the track record \- across multiple games, along the lifetime of their career. *\#B4mad Racing* enables them to work on their driving style and most important their skills, through innovative products and comparing their ability with other drivers.

*\#B4mad Racing* \- the product and the organization \- are built upon Web3 Technology to ensure a lifelong track record that can be trusted, and build a community that is eager to get involved. It will spawn a platform, with economics that enable an ecosystem for innovative products.

* *4 life: history of a game, the career mode*

## Technical Background

Most sim racing games offer a wealth of telemetry data, such as speed, lap times and motor data, e.g. [Simhubdash](https://www.simhubdash.com/). There is a rich ecosystem of tools that use the data and create additional value to the sim-racer \- such as driving external displays for telemetry data or input to hardware accessories. Although the data stream format varies slightly from game to game, the fundamentals are always the same, it’s car telemetry after all.

## Products

*\#B4mad Racing* is a **platform** that enables multiple future products. At its core, there is a driver identity system and a telemetry data collection platform to build personalized sim racing products. Data transformation and analytics pipelines are an integral part of the platform.

### Driver Identity

Users can sign up and claim a unique driver name and populate their profile. All data can be changed later, but all changes are recorded on a public blockchain. By using Web3 technology cheating and manipulation of past records becomes unblushable.

### Telemetry Collection

This is a foundational building block for most products. It consists of lightweight software that is installed on the local machine \- or network \- which collects the raw telemetry stream and uploads it to a service running on the internet. The service extracts all known telemetry into a common format and stores it in a database.

### Data Pipelines

All the telemetry data is processed by a pipeline architecture. It is used to provide statistics on the profile page. The data is also made accessible via views which can be pushed into data products by 3rd parties.

### Free Tier

Users can visualize telemetry data on specialized dashboards and compare their metrics over time and with other users.
A ranking system assigns scores to races and practice runs so that users can see themselves ranked in different leagues and classes.
This is mainly statistical analysis and visualization.
All the data is owned by the driver and can be downloaded by the driver.

### Paid Tiers

Complete telemetry data
Driving Style analysis (early breaker, rowdy, coward)
Driving recommendations
AI co-driver, the driving school
Car setups (AI generated, personalized on driving style)
NFT Livery \- you own your unique livery
reusable data pipes for 3rd party products \- this is Twitter for telemetry

* cross-game championship series
* Coaching by a professional \- pro-level rated by platform
* …

# Economics

## Market Analysis

iRacing has [200k](https://www.iracing.com/overview/) users, which subscribe to their paid subscription. Racedepartment.com used SteamDB to see [how many players](https://www.racedepartment.com/news/how-popular-are-our-favourite-pc-racing-sims.307/) are playing some of the more popular games. The combined 24-hour peaks of the games are \~30k concurrent average players for the more simulation-focused games. Racedepartment.com itself has 2 million registered members. They also offer a similar product to \#B4mad Racing \-  called [https://www.simracing.gp/](https://www.simracing.gp/) \- which is currently in beta but does not seem to be focused so much on telemetry data and driver history.

Let’s assume we have a market of 1.000.000 potential users and every 4th user signs up for the free service. This will result in 250.000 registered users. If we have a conservative conversion rate of 10% into the paid tier, we’d get 25.000 paying subscribers.
The average cost of a paid product is approx 5 USD / month, resulting in 125.000 USD monthly revenue.

## Tokenomics

### Crypto Token

We have created a crypto currency \-  [\#B4racer (BRRR)](https://polygonscan.com/token/0x2403f6679f76b6ab3cbe2fd2617a8cbc02bfda15) \- to enable:

1) members to vote on decisions, such as feature requests
2) members to participate in revenue generated by the project
3) early funding of project development
4) creation of an economical ecosystem on the platform

#### Community participation

The project is structured as a [DAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_\(organization\)) \- a Decentralized autonomous organization. The project is fully owned and steered by the DAO, i.e. each token holder is a voting member of the DAO.
To enable a fair community vote on project decisions such as features, marketing, and direction, the token serves as a weighted vote.
We plan to allow members to take over decision-making immediately.

#### Revenue participation

Like a traditional company share might pay out a dividend and therefore incentivize owners to hold the share, owners of the BRRR token will participate in all revenue generated by the platform. This creates a strong identification and bond between them and the platform.

#### Project funding

In order to bootstrap the project, we depend on early seed investors. This funding is done by selling tokens, pricing will depend on the progress of the project. Pretty much like a traditional seed investor would get company shares at an early discounted price.
The acquired money is used to cover costs, such as developers, contractors and infrastructure.
Additionally, the tokens can be used as an alternative currency to pay and incentivize developers and contributors.

#### Economical Ecosystem

* tokens are used to pay the service subscription
* tokens are used to get access to products created on the platform
* payment for any additional digital good or services transaction
* BRRR might be converted from and to other currencies (crypto or real) on distributed exchanges.
* a virtual wallet for crypto currencies is required to own BRRR

# Development

The fundamental building blocks of software development are modern and forward looking. We believe in Web3 technology for identity management and economics. Scalability and future longevity is realized via cloud-native technology and open-source based components. Whenever possible we’ll use and implement the software stack as open-source software.
Development is executed via distributed platforms such as GitHub and Gitcoin.

### Timeline

Development is dictated by funds available, it will launch with the first funds flowing into the project \- either via private series or public funding . The created code and/or other assets are owned by the DAO. The usage licenses will be …

#### Phase 0, Round A

* whitepaper complete ✅
* founder funding ✅

# Community

We want to provide a platform, that is super focused on the needs of their users, therefore we strive to involve them as much as possible. A vivid feature request culture is a significant part of the development work creating the platform.

## Incentives for leads

* 100.000 USD worth of tokens (shares)
* mainly steering work, funding via outsourcing (gitcoin, fiverr)

## Leadership Team

Our leadership team ist setting the direction of our products and platform. The driving forces are: community and racing, supported by strong user experience and data science.
The weights and focus might change over time, the initial structure does not imply a hierarchy, nor a static organization. We want to be quick and open to change \- a DAO.
The leadership team is steering and controlling our activities, not doing and implementing.
The leadership team is a critical and initial part of the DAO, and their experience is key to the success, honoring this fact they will receive a significant and equal share of the DAO.
