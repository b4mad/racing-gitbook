# \#B4mad eSport Data Platform

## Summary

B4mad eSports is conceptualized as a comprehensive platform designed to support competitive gaming services by providing a robust infrastructure. The initial focus is on the growing sim-racing market, supported by a viable prototype.  The founder has 25+ years of background in Open Source Software development and building AI and data platforms at Red Hat.

## Simracing Coaching

Sim racers enjoy the process of data collection, skill enhancement, and engaging in spirited competition. Mastering a track and consistently improving lap times requires tenacity, discipline, and a significant time investment.
B4mad Racing is designed to chronicle a driver's history across various games, enabling racers to refine their skills via innovative products and by comparing their performance with other competitors. The user base spans from casual players to more committed enthusiasts.

### Prototype

Sim racing games offer a wealth of telemetry data, such as speed, lap times, and motor data. We collect this telemetry, storing it securely in a cloud-based platform.
By analyzing aggregated data from all drivers, we are able to construct models for racing tracks. During a racing session, this telemetry data stream is harnessed to provide personalized recommendations, helping drivers enhance their lap times. This is delivered via a text-to-speech system \- reminiscent of having a personal driving coach in the passenger seat. The existing prototype integrates with 5 sim-racing titles and has 200,000+ recorded laps and 90 active users.

### Simracing Platform

The coaching application is just the inaugural product of a broader platform that specializes in sim-racing data collection, processing, and hosting sim-racing applications.
Currently, most sim-racing services, including coaching sessions, telemetry collection, and live race dashboards, operate independently, each needing to build and maintain its own infrastructure.
Our platform intends to streamline this process by serving as a comprehensive base, catering to a wide range of services and providing the underlying architecture necessary for each service. This model aligns with established patterns seen in successful platforms like OpenStack in the telecommunications industry.
