# Technical Background

Most sim racing games offer a wealth of telemetry data, such as speed, lap times and motor data, e.g. [Simhubdash](https://www.simhubdash.com/). There is a rich ecosystem of tools that use the data and create additional value to the sim-racer - such as driving external displays for telemetry data or input to hardware accessories.

Although the data stream format varies slightly from game to game, the fundamentals are always the same, it's car telemetry after all.
