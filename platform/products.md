# Products

*#B4mad Racing* is a **platform** that enables multiple future products. At its core, there is a driver identity system and a telemetry data collection platform to build personalized sim racing products. Data transformation and analytics pipelines are an integral part of the platform.

## Driver Identity

Users can sign up and claim a unique driver name and populate their profile. All data can be changed later, but all changes are recorded on a public blockchain. By using Web3 technology cheating and manipulation of past records becomes unblushable.

## Telemetry Collection

This is a foundational building block for most products. It consists of lightweight software that is installed on the local machine - or network - which collects the raw telemetry stream and uploads it to a service running on the internet. The service extracts all known telemetry into a common format and stores it in a database.

## Data Pipelines

All the telemetry data is processed by a pipeline architecture. It is used to provide statistics on the profile page. The data is also made accessible via views which can be pushed into data products by 3rd parties.

## Free Tier

Users can visualize telemetry data on specialized dashboards and compare their metrics over time and with other users.
A ranking system assigns scores to races and practice runs so that users can see themselves ranked in different leagues and classes.
This is mainly statistical analysis and visualization.
All the data is owned by the driver and can be downloaded by the driver.
